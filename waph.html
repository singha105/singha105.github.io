    <h3>Web Application Programming and Hacking Course Information</h3>
    <p>
      This course introduces students to the fundamentals of web development and cybersecurity. Topics include front-end programming
      (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript) and back-end scripting (PHP, MySQL). Students explore common vulnerabilities such as XSS, CSRF, and
      SQL Injection, and learn to apply secure coding practices through hands-on labs, hackathons, and a project.
    </p>

    <h3>Overview of Lab 0</h3>
    <p>
      Lab 0 was focused on environment setup. I configured an Ubuntu VM and installed essential tools such as Apache2, Git, and net-tools.
      I also cloned the course repository from GitHub and ensured proper Apache configuration for web access using localhost.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Overview of Lab 1</h3>
    <p>
      This lab explored HTTP fundamentals. I used Telnet to manually craft HTTP requests and analyzed traffic using Wireshark. Additionally,
      I created a simple PHP-based form to process GET and POST requests. These activities reinforced understanding of HTTP protocols.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Overview of Lab 2</h3>
    <p>
      Lab 2 focused on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). I created an HTML page vulnerable to JavaScript injection, then demonstrated payloads
      that exploited it. I also integrated public APIs (Joke API and Weather) using jQuery and Fetch, while testing defenses like encoding
      and content sanitization.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Overview of Hackathon 1</h3>
    <p>
      Hackathon 1 challenged students to exploit advanced XSS vulnerabilities in a lab environment. I used injection techniques in URL paths
      and HTML attributes (e.g., onmouseover) to trigger alerts. This activity deepened my understanding of web security risks and the
      importance of strong input validation.

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Overview of Individual Project</h3>
    <p>
      The final project involved building an interactive resume website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery. Features included
      digital and analog clocks, cookie-based visit tracking, public API integrations (joke, comic, weather), and a dark mode toggle.
      This project showcased my ability to combine design, interactivity, and basic security principles into a professional web application.
